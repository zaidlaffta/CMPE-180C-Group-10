#Why UNIX Shell and History Feature?

UNIX Shell with History Feature is simply creating a small shell that executes basic Unix commands. This program is a C base programing language program where we will have a user interface allowing the user to enter commands and execute them. Having a user interface and command execution is simple and easy thing to achieve, but what makes this program special is the history feature in it. In this day and age most of the big names in the tech field have a history feature like Cisco, Aruba, and HPE procurve just to name a few. We will modify the shell interface and add the history feature. The end user will be able to access the most recent commands entered.
